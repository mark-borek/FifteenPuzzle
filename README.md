# FifteenPuzzle
This is a project that was done for my web programming in Javascript class. It is your classic fifteen puzzle. It uses object oriented javascript for the logic of the game, and html/css to display it. Randomize the game to play and the page will let you know when you have returned the game to its original configuration.
